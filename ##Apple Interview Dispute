##Apple Interview Dispute

I ended up ditching apple or vice-versa (Dispute with the recruiter in question: Rad Akbari).

Manager in Munich: Stephan Auer, Engineer: someone ....

My mistake as I thought I already had a position from a different US startup and gambled it at max: I made it clear. Apple for USA, Not Apple for Germany.

Countless move of interviews: I made it clear to them: unprofessional. but the interview itself is not hard. (Hard but not hard as google)
The following is a summary and I shall remember and post all the questions both from the Manager (ex TUM PhD & apple engineer ex TUM student).

## Video Group Munich.
## Enjoy and destroy the interviews.

## I will post all the questions as I remember them.
